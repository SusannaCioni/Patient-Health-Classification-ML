# Patient-Health-Classification-ML
Patient Health Data Classification – 
This repository contains a group project focused on the classification of patient health data. The objective was to predict health outcomes based on clinical variables, addressing challenges like class imbalance and feature selection.

My Role & Contribution
As part of a multidisciplinary team, I was responsible for Phase 3: Machine Learning Modeling. Building upon the data preprocessing and feature engineering conducted in previous phases, I implemented and evaluated predictive models to ensure robust performance.

Key activities included:

Model Implementation: Developed classification models using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Trees.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model parameters to improve accuracy and generalization.

Performance Evaluation: Conducted rigorous testing using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision and Recall to assess the models' clinical relevance.

Analysis: Interpreted results to identify which clinical variables most significantly influenced the predictions.

Technologies Used

Language: Python.
Libraries: Scikit-Learn (for SVM and Decision Trees), Pandas, NumPy.
Environment: Google Colab.

How to use
This notebook (Progetto.ipynb) represents the final modeling stage. It requires the preprocessed dataset generated in the earlier phases of the project.
